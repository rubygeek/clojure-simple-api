# simple-api

A simple api as a placeholder for CRUD. Data is stored in an array as an atom. 

After Clojure 1.9 came out, I changed out the [Plumatic Schema](https://github.com/plumatic/schema) for [Clojure Spec](https://www.clojure.org/guides/spec). 

I have two entities [Source](/src/simple_api/specs/source.clj) and [Recipe](/src/simple_api/specs/recipe.clj).

Previously with Schema I used coerse! to get a valid recipe, but now with spec I conform. Not really a 1 to 1 replacement since I believe coerse! would modify the data to fit structure (ie convert a string to a keyword).

 Another change with Schema I had an exception on an invalid record, with Spec I get a `:clojure.spec.alpha/invalid` which I guess is better. Exceptions should be reserved for when something "really" is exceptional and not an invalid record.

Intereting bits are in [models](/src/simple-api/models.clj]) and probably could remove the compojure app altogether.

I also added [Clojure Reloaded](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded) to this since that is how I prefer to work now.

Interesting exercise at the least.

```clojure
user=> (require '[simple-api.models :as m])

user=> (m/add! {:name "7 Can Soup"  :source {:name "Food Network" :url "www.foodnetwork.com"}  :url "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/7-can-soup"})
{:source {:url "www.foodnetwork.com", :name "Food Network"}, :name "7 Can Soup", :url "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/7-can-soup", :id 2}


user=> (m/recipe-count)
1

user=> (m/get-recipe 2)
{:source {:url "www.foodnetwork.com", :name "Food Network"}, :name "7 Can Soup", :url "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/7-can-soup", :id 2}

user=> (m/update! (assoc-in (m/get-recipe 2) [:name] "7-Can Soup"))
{:source {:url "www.foodnetwork.com", :name "Food Network"}, :name "7-Can Soup", :url "http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/7-can-soup", :id 2}
```
